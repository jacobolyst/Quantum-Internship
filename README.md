# Quantum-Internship
A few exercises which I did during the Quantum Internship recruitment process.

The tasks were about testing programming skills in Python - the first two were more about solving a problem through strictly programming, while the third task dealt with problems in the genre of data science. The problems are described in more detail in their respective notebooks.

Tools: Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
